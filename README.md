# BookStore 


# Project Summary :- 
this project is my capstone project of odinschool reactjs Web Development Bootcamp.
My  taske is to  develope a React project for an online bookstore. The bookstore wants a user-friendly interface where customers can browse books, search for specific titles or authors, view book details, and make purchases. Additionally, they want to incorporate a user authentication system to allow customers to create accounts, log in, and track their order history.
