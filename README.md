# BookStore 


# Project Summary :- 
this project is my capstone project of odinschool reactjs Web Development Bootcamp.
My  taske is to  develope a React project for an online bookstore. The bookstore wants a user-friendly interface where customers can browse books, search for specific titles or authors, view book details, and make purchases. Additionally, they want to incorporate a user authentication system to allow customers to create accounts, log in, and track their order history.

# Requirements:-

# 1. Homepage
* Display featured books to capture users' attention.
  
# 2. Book Listing
* Implement a page where users can see a list of books based on selected genres.
* Include sorting and filtering options (e.g., by author, price, release date).
  
# 3. Search Functionality
* Implement a search bar allowing users to search for books by title or author.
* Display search results dynamically.
  
# 4. Book Details
* Create a detailed view for each book, showing its cover, description, author, and price.
  
# 5. User Authentication
* Allow users to register and log in.
* Restrict certain features (e.g., making a purchase, viewing order history) to authenticated users.
  
# 6. Shopping Cart
* Enable users to add books to a shopping cart.
* Implement the ability to modify the cart (add and remove items).

# 7. Checkout Process
* Create a multi-step checkout process.
* Include a form for users to input shipping information.

# 10. Responsive Design
* Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various devices.

# 12. State Management
* Use state management solutions such as Redux to manage the application's state effectively.

# 13. Testing
* Implement unit testing for critical components to ensure functionality.

# 14. Security
* Implement secure authentication practices.
* Ensure that sensitive user information is handled securely.

# 15. Performance Optimization
Optimize the application for performance, especially during the checkout process.

# 16. Documentation
Provide documentation for developers and maintainers, including instructions for setting up the project locally.

# 17. Deployment
Deploy the application to a hosting service of choice (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

# Considerations
Use React Router for navigation.
Employ best practices in React development.
Utilize a styling approach, whether it's plain CSS, SCSS.

# Getting Started with Create React App











This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
